# Knyle Style Sheets

This is a ruby library for parsing KSS documented stylesheets and generating styleguides.

Inspired by [TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org), KSS attempts to provide a methodology for writing maintainable, documented CSS within a team. Specifically, KSS is a CSS structure, documentation specification, and styleguide format. It is **not** a preprocessor, CSS framework, naming convention, or specificity guideline.

## Spec
