# Knyle Style Sheets

Inspired by [TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org), KSS attempts to provide a methodology for writing maintainable, documented CSS within a team. Specifically, KSS is a documentation specification, styleguide specification, and CSS formatting specification. It is **not** a preprocessor, CSS framework, or guidance on how to structure your CSS rules.

## Purpose

KSS is a set of guidelines to help you produce an HTML styleguide tied to CSS documentation that is nice to read in plain text, yet structured enough to be automatically extracted and processed by a machine. It is designed with CSS preprocessors (such as SCSS or LESS) in mind, and flexible enough to accommodate a multitude of CSS frameworks (such as YUI, Blueprint or 960).

It is important to understand that the styleguide format and documentation format are intrinsically tied to one another.
