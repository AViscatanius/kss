<p class="subdued">KSS is intended to help automate the creation of a living styleguide. The styleguide serves as a place to publish KSS documentation and visualize different states of UI elements defined in your CSS.</p>

## Styleguide Examples

It's sometimes hard to explain what a living styleguide is. The best way to explain is through examples. The [GitHub CSS Styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/css) is a good example of a living styleguide generated with KSS.

In particular, you can see the value of KSS on pages like the [buttons section](https://github.com/styleguide/css/1.0).
